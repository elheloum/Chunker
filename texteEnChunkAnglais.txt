He
was
just
about
to
start
graduate
school
in
1998
when
researchers
first
worked
out
how
to
derive
human
embryonic
stem
cells
.
In
the
two
decades
since
,
the
prolific
cells
have
been
a
fixture
of
his
career
.
The
biologist
,
now
at
Columbia
University
in
New
York
City
,
has
used
them
to
explore
how
DNA
from
adult
cells
can
be
reprogrammed
to
an
embryonic
state
,
and
to
tackle
questions
about
the
development
and
treatment
of
diabetes
.
He
has
even
helped
to
develop
an
entirely
new
form
of
human
embryonic
stem
cell
that
could
simplify
studies
on
what
different
human
genes
do
.
His
wide-ranging
research
established
him
as
a
leader
in
embryonic
stem-cell
biology
,
a
field
challenged
by
restricted
funding
and
an
enthusiasm
for
competing
technologies
that
don’t
carry
the
same
ethical
baggage
.
Still
,
many
say
that
human
embryonic
stem
cells
are
now
more
relevant
than
ever
.
I
am
very
excited
about
embryonic
stem
cells
,
says
Egli
.
They
will
lead
to
unprecedented
discoveries
that
will
transform
life
.
I
have
no
doubt
about
it
.

Embryonic
stem
(
ES
)
cells
provide
unparallelled
information
on
early
development
.
Like
astronomers
looking
back
to
the
Big
Bang
for
fundamental
insight
about
the
Universe
,
biologists
rake
over
the
molecules
inside
these
remarkable
entities
for
clues
as
to
how
a
single
original
cell
turns
into
trillions
,
with
a
dizzying
array
of
forms
and
functions
.
Scientists
have
learnt
how
to
turn
the
cells
into
dozens
of
mature
cell
types
representing
various
tissues
and
organs
in
the
body
.
These
are
used
to
test
drugs
,
to
model
disease
and
,
increasingly
,
as
therapies
injected
into
the
body
.
Starting
with
an
attempt
to
repair
spinal-cord
injuries
in
2010
,
there
have
been
more
than
a
dozen
clinical
trials
of
cells
created
from
ES
cells
to
treat
Parkinson’s
disease
and
diabetes
,
among
other
conditions
.
Early
results
suggest
that
some
approaches
are
working
,
a
long-awaited
report
this
week
shows
improved
vision
in
two
people
with
age-related
macular
degeneration
,
a
disease
that
destroys
the
sharpness
of
vision
.
